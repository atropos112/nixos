# What is this dir for?

This is setup and dependencies to do programming with various languages.

When I have `yaml.nix` it means whatever is needed to be productive
with yamls, LSPs, etc.

Do note, I could add something like `yarn` to `markdown.nix` because its a
dependency of some markdown tool even thoguh its obviously javascript and
not markdown. Its about what I use it for and not what its intended for in
typical usage.
