# What is a module?

A nixos module that fulfills a specific purpose and is not the implementation
of its own.

There is a bit of a blured line, at which point is it implementation or module.
My rule of thumb is, if someone else can't use it then its already an implementation.
I realise this is still a bit fuzzy, but I think it's a good rule of thumb.
